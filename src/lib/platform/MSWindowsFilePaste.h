/*!
Offers a FileClip to Windows applications as CF_HDROP with delayed rendering,
from a window on a thread of its own.  When an application pastes, Windows
asks that window for the data and makes the application wait.  The thread
then asks the screen that copied the files to send them, waits for them to
arrive, gives them back their own names in a folder of their own, and hands
the application that list.  Only this thread waits; the rest of Leapdesk
keeps running.
